## Description

I made this project to incorporate lessons learned using form/input elements, local storage, and practice more query selectors. This project creates a fun, timed quiz to test a users basic knowledge of web development. I learned how to create form/input elements with proper type values, and I learned how to create a timer element.

## Installation

Open the index.html file

## Usage

1. First complete the quiz.

2. When the quiz is complete, it'll ask you for your initials, then click submit.

3. If you wish to see your initials and high score, click on view score (doesn't actually work)
